    "q1": "How is a translation quoted?",
    "a1": "The quote is determined on a personalized basis, based on a detailed analysis of the original document. The things I take into account are: the source and target languages, format, content type, and file quality. I do not apply automatic rates: each project is evaluated individually to provide a quote tailored to the actual complexity of the work.",
    "q2": "What types of files can I send?",
    "a2": "I work with files in .doc, .docx, .pdf, .jpg, and .png formats, which are the most common for scanned text or images. The important thing is that the content is legible and that the file clearly reflects the original. If the file cannot be viewed correctly, I will contact you to request another version. If you have a file in another format, please feel free to contact me so I can evaluate whether it can be processed.",
    "q3": "How long will it take to receive a response?",
    "a3": "You'll typically receive a quote within 24 to 48 business hours of sending me the document. If the file is in good condition, the analysis is faster. If I need to clarify anything specific, I'll contact you immediately to resolve it and avoid delays. My commitment is to provide you with a prompt response, while maintaining the seriousness and attention to detail that the work requires."
